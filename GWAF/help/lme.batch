_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit linear mixed effect model to test association between a
     continuous phenotype  and all SNPs in a genotype file with user
     specified genetic model. The SNP genotype is treated as fixed
     effects, and a random effect correlated according to degree of
     relatedness within a  family is also fitted. In each trait-SNP
     assocaition test, the 'lmekin()' function which is modified from
     the same named function in package 'kinship' is used.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     lme.batch(phenfile, genfile, pedfile, phen, kinmat, model = "a", 
     covars = NULL, outfile)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 genfile: a character string naming the genotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

phenfile: a character string naming the phenotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 pedfile: a character string naming the pedigree file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 outfile: a character string naming the result file for writing 

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile 

  covars: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

   model: a single character of 'a','d','g', or 'r', with 'a'=additive,
          'd'=dominant, 'g'=general and 'r'=recessive models 

  kinmat: a character string naming the file where kinship coefficient
          matrix is kept 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The 'lme.batch' function first reads in and merges comma-delimited
     phenotype-covariates, genotype  and pedigree files, then tests the
     association of 'phen' against all SNPs in 'genfile'. 'genfile' is
     a comma delimited file, with the column names being "id" and SNP
     names separated by comma. For each SNP, the genotype data should
     be coded as 0, 1, 2 indicating the numbers of less frequent 
     alleles. The SNP name in genotype file should not have any  dash,
     '-' and other special characters(dots and underscores are OK).
     'phenfile' is a comma delimited file, with the column names being
     "id" and phenotype and  covaraite names separated by comma.
     'pedfile' is a comma delimited file, with the column names being 
     "famid","id","fa","mo","sex". In all files, missing value should
     be an empty space. SNPs with low genotype counts (especially minor
     allele homozygote) may be omitted or analyzed with dominant model.
     The 'lme.batch' function fits linear mixed effects (LME) model
     using   with 'lme.batch' function from GWAF package and a modified
     'lmekin' function from 'kinship' package.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     No value is returned. Instead, results are written to 'outfile'.
     When the genetic model is 'a', 'd' or 'r', the result includes the
     following columns. When the genetic model is 'g', 'beta' and 'se'
     are replaced with 'beta10', 'beta20','beta21','se10','se20','se21'
     .

   phen : phenotype name

    snp : SNP name

     n0 : the number of individuals with 0 copy of minor alleles

     n1 : the number of individuals with 1 copy of minor alleles

     n2 : the number of individuals with 2 copies of minor alleles

    h2q : the portion of phenotypic variation explained by the SNP

   beta : regression coefficient of SNP covariate

     se : standard error of 'beta'

  chisq : Chi-square statistic for testing 'beta' not equal to zero

     df : degree of freedom of the Chi-square statistic

  model : model actually used in the analysis

   pval : p-value of the chi-square statistic

        : 

 beta10 : regression coefficient of genotype with 1 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 0 copy

 beta20 : regression coefficient of genotype with 2 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 0 copy

 beta21 : regression coefficient of genotype with 2 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 1 copy

   se10 : standard error of 'beta10'

   se20 : standard error of 'beta20'

   se21 : standard error of 'beta21'
