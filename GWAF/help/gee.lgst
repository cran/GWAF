_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit logistic regression via GEE to test association between a
     dichotomous phenotype  and one SNP in a genotype file with user
     specified genetic model. Each family is treated as  a cluster,
     with independence working correlation matrix used in the robust
     variance estimator. This function is called in gee.lgst.batch
     function to apply association test to all SNPs in a  genotype
     data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gee.lgst(snp, phen, test.dat, covar = NULL, model = "a")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     snp: genotype data of a SNP 

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile 

test.dat: the product of merging phenotype, genotype and pedigree data,
          should be ordered by "famid" 

   covar: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

   model: a single character of 'a','d','g', or 'r', with 'a'=additive,
          'd'=dominant, 'g'=general and 'r'=recessive models 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The 'gee.lgst' function tests association between a dichtomous
     trait (phen) and a SNP (snp) from a dataset that contains
     phenotype, genotype and  pedigree data (test.dat), where the
     dataset needs to be ordered by famid.
