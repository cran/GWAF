_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit logistic regression via GEE to test association between a
     dichotomous phenotype  and all imputed SNPs in a genotype file.
     Each family is treated as  a cluster, with independence working
     correlation matrix used in the robust variance estimator. This
     function applies the same trait-SNP association test to all SNPs
     in the imputed genotype data.  The trait-SNP association test is
     carried out by gee.lgst function where the  the 'gee()' function
     from package 'gee' is used.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gee.lgst.batch.imputed(genfile, phenfile, pedfile, outfile, phen, covars = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 genfile: a character string naming the genotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

phenfile: a character string naming the phenotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 pedfile: a character string naming the pedigree file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 outfile: a character string naming the result file for writing 

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile 

  covars: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Similar to the details for 'gee.lgst.batch' but here the SNP data
     contains imputed genotypes (allele dosages)  that are continuous
     and range from 0 to 2. In addition, the user  specified genetic
     model argument is not available.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     No value is returned. Instead, results are written to 'outfile'.

   phen : phenotype name

    snp : SNP name

      N : the number of individuals in analysis

     Nd : the number of individuals in affected sample in analysis

     AF : imputed allele frequency of coded allele

    AFd : imputed allele frequency of coded allele in affected sample

   beta : regression coefficient of SNP covariate

     se : standard error of 'beta'

 remark : warning or additional information for the analysis, note that
          the genotype counts are based on rounded imputed genotypes;
          'not converged' indicates the  GEE analysis did not converge;
          'logistic reg' indicates GEE model is replaced by logistic
          regression; 'exp count<5' indicates any expected count is
          less than 5 in phenotype-genotype table; 'not converged  and
          exp count<5', 'logistic reg & exp count<5' are noted
          similarly; 'collinearity' indicates collinearity exists
          between SNP and some covariates

   pval : p-value of the chi-square statistic
