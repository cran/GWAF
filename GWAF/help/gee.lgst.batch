_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit logistic regression via GEE to test association between a
     dichotomous phenotype  and all SNPs in a genotype file with user
     specified genetic model. Each family is treated as  a cluster,
     with independence working correlation matrix used in the robust
     variance estimator. This function applies the same trait-SNP
     association test to all SNPs in a genotype data containing  at
     least 2 SNPs. The trait-SNP association test is carried out by
     gee.lgst function where the  the 'gee()' function from package
     'gee' is used.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gee.lgst.batch(genfile, phenfile, pedfile, outfile, phen, covars = NULL, 
     model = "a")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 genfile: a character string naming the genotype file for reading(see
          format requirement in details) 

phenfile: a character string naming the phenotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 pedfile: a character string naming the pedigree file for reading(see
          format requirement in details) 

 outfile: a character string naming the result file for writing 

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile 

  covars: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

   model: a single character of 'a','d','g', or 'r', with 'a'=additive,
          'd'=dominant, 'g'=general and 'r'=recessive models 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The 'gee.lgst.batch'  function first reads in and merges
     comma-delimited phenotype-covariates, genotype  and pedigree
     files, then tests the association of 'phen' against all SNPs in
     'genfile'. 'genfile' is a comma delimited file, with the column
     names being "id" and SNP names separated by comma. For each SNP,
     the genotype data should be coded as 0, 1, 2 indicating the
     numbers of less frequent  alleles. The SNP names in genotype file
     should not have any  dash, '-' and other special characters(dots
     and underscores are OK). 'phenfile' is a comma delimited file,
     with the column names being "id" and phenotype and  covaraite
     names separated by comma. 'pedfile' is a comma delimited file,
     with the column names being  "famid","id","fa","mo","sex". In all
     files, missing value should be an empty space. Only phenotypes
     with two categories are analyzed. A phenotype should be coded as 
     0 and 1, with 1 denoting affected and 0 unaffected. SNPs with low
     genotype counts  (especially minor allele homozygote) may be
     omitted or analyzed with dominant model or analyzed with logistic
     regression.  The 'gee.lgst.batch' function fits Generalized
     Estimation Equation (GEE) model using each pedigree as a cluster 
     with 'gee.lgst' function from GWAF package and 'gee' function from
     'gee' package.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     No value is returned. Instead, results are written to 'outfile'.
     When the genetic model is 'a', 'd' or 'r', the result includes the
     following columns. When the genetic model is 'g', 'beta' and 'se'
     are replaced with 'beta10', 'beta20','beta21','se10','se20','se21'
     .

   phen : phenotype name

    snp : SNP name

     n0 : the number of individuals with 0 copy of minor alleles

     n1 : the number of individuals with 1 copy of minor alleles

     n2 : the number of individuals with 2 copies of minor alleles

    nd0 : the number of individuals with 0 copy of minor alleles in
          affected sample

    nd1 : the number of individuals with 1 copy of minor alleles in
          affected sample

    nd2 : the number of individuals with 2 copies of minor alleles in
          affected sample

 miss.0 : Genotype missing rate in unaffected sample 

 miss.1 : Genotype missing rate in affected sample 

miss.diff.p : P-value of differential missingness test between
          unaffected and affected samples 

   beta : regression coefficient of SNP covariate

     se : standard error of 'beta'

  chisq : Chi-square statistic for testing 'beta' not equal to zero

     df : degree of freedom of the Chi-square statistic

  model : model actually used in the analysis

 remark : warning or additional information for the analysis, 'not
          converged' indicates the  GEE analysis did not converge;
          'logistic reg' indicates GEE model is replaced by logistic
          regression; 'exp count<5' indicates any expected count is
          less than 5 in phenotype-genotype table; 'not converged  and
          exp count<5', 'logistic reg & exp count<5' are noted
          similarly; 'collinearity' indicates collinearity exists
          between SNP and some covariates

   pval : p-value of the chi-square statistic

        : 

 beta10 : regression coefficient of genotype with 1 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 0 copy

 beta20 : regression coefficient of genotype with 2 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 0 copy

 beta21 : regression coefficient of genotype with 2 copy of minor
          allele vs. that with 1 copy

   se10 : standard error of 'beta10'

   se20 : standard error of 'beta20'

   se21 : standard error of 'beta21'
