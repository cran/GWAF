_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit linear mixed effects model to test association between a
     continuous phenotype  and all imputed SNPs in a genotype file. The
     SNP genotype is treated as fixed effects, and a random effect
     correlated according to degree of relatedness within a  family is
     also fitted. In each trait-SNP assocaition test, the 'lmekin()'
     function which is modified from the same named function in package
     'kinship' is used.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     lme.batch.imputed(phenfile, genfile, pedfile, phen, kinmat, covars=NULL, 
     outfile, col.names=T, sep.ped=",", sep.phe=",", sep.gen=",")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

phenfile: a character string naming the phenotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 genfile: a character string naming the genotype file for reading (see
          format requirement in details) 

 pedfile: a character string naming the pedigree file for reading (see
          format requirement in details)

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile  

  kinmat: a character string naming the file where kinship coefficient
          matrix is kept 

  covars: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

 outfile: a character string naming the result file for writing 

col.names: a logical value indicating whether the output file should
          contain column names 

 sep.ped: the field separator character for pedigree file 

 sep.phe: the field separator character for phenotype file 

 sep.gen: the field separator character for genotype file 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Similar to the details for 'lme.batch' function but here the SNP
     data contains imputed genotypes (allele dosages)  that are
     continuous and range from 0 to 2. In addition, the user specified
     genetic model argument is not available.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     No value is returned. Instead, results are written to 'outfile'.

   phen : phenotype name

    snp : SNP name

      N : the number of individuals in analysis

     AF : imputed allele frequency of coded allele

    h2q : the portion of phenotypic variation explained by the SNP

   beta : regression coefficient of SNP covariate

     se : standard error of 'beta'

   pval : p-value of the chi-square statistic
