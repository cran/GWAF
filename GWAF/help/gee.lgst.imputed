_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Fit logistic regression via GEE to test association between a
     dichotomous phenotype  and one imputed SNP in a genotype file.
     Each family is treated as  a cluster, with independence working
     correlation matrix used in the robust variance estimator. This
     function is called in 'gee.lgst.batch.imputed' function to apply
     association test to all imputed SNPs in the  genotype data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gee.lgst.imputed(snp, phen, test.dat, covar = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     snp: imputed genotype data of a SNP

    phen: a character string for a phenotype name in phenfile 

test.dat: the product of merging phenotype, genotype and pedigree data,
          should be ordered by "famid" 

   covar: a character vector for covariates in phenfile 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Similar to the details for 'gee.lgst' function but here the SNP
     data contains imputed genotypes (allele dosages)  that are
     continuous and range from 0 to 2. In addition, the user specified
     genetic model argument is not available.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Please see output in 'gee.lgst.batch.imputed'.
